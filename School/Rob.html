<h1><p>
The Submarine Crash</p></h1>

“Rob, come down for dinner!” Rob’s mother, Mim hollered. Slowly, Rob glided down the stairwell, and then he bolted down, after smelling homemade red plankton with white fish eggs on the side.  Ravenously, he demolished the plankton in two swift gulps. Rob looked at Mim’s office with longing, as he had spotted his mother's key for driving her submarine on her neon green rocking chair. Mim had seen the look of longing in his eyes and questioned him, “do you want to go out of the cave and drive your toy?” 
Quickly, Rob responded “of course!” 

When Rob had passed his doorstep, he was out of the cave. He scanned the area and spotted schools of blue, green, and even purple fish. He kept scanning the area spotting turquoise kelp, maroon crabs, and yellow pufferfish. 
<p>
Quickly, Mim and Rob swam away from their cave so fast that they left streaks of bubbles behind them. As they sped away, Rob gazed at their surroundings, happily spotting his toy submarine. Meanwhile, Mim was also admiring the toy as it had orange lightning, lime green polka dots, and pink wavy lines printed on to it. Eagerly, Rob hopped into his toy, and sped away. His submarine looked like lightning, bolting away from his mother. He steered his toy back to Mim after a few laps around the block and happily, he swam out. </p>

After driving Rob’s mind felt like it was on a roller coaster and there was so much to think about.  Something was nagging at his mind, and whenever he looked at his mom’s key he felt angry. Could it have been because his mom can drive a real submarine but he couldn’t? Well, Rob thought, “a good night sleep will make me feel better.”  So he darted to his room and catapulted into bed like being chased by a bunch of sharks. Rob fell asleep as if he had been knocked out as he was exhausted. Later, he woke up, still angry about not being able to drive a real submarine.
<p>
It was still early in the morning and Mim hadn’t awaken, so he crept out of bed and glided down his kelp covered stairs. He spotted his mother’s key and grabbed it. Careful to leave no bubbles behind he crept to the front door. He opened the door and went outside, then rushed to Mim’s unlocked submarine. Rob questioned himself “how could I make this the best morning ever?”</p>

 He shoved Mim’s key into the ignition and slammed his neon orange tentacle on the pedal. Accelerating, Rob saw a jellyfish with bright green eyes and wavy blue hair staring back at him as he looked at the mirror. Adrenaline taking over, he shot out of his garage and missed a red light. He gasped in relief as another driver stopped so that they didn’t collide. Rob was enjoying the drive so much that he didn’t realise that his engine was steaming. He took a sharp left turn and the propeller nicked a stop sign.  He took a U-Turn, slammed the gas pedal harder, and returned home. Before he had made it to the garage, everything he saw went from colorful to black as the engine of the submarine had exploded and knocked Rob unconscious. Rob had pushed the submarine too hard. 
<p>
That was the last day Rob could see color. However, he had also learned a very valuable lesson, and with his eyes as a constant reminder, he would never use anything without permission.</p>
